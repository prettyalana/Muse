# Muse

An app designed for the customer by the customer. 

Muse is a customer driven app that prioritizes the customer's needs by bringing the seller to the buyer. Instead of looking through countless listings only to not find what you’re looking for; you create a listing containing the item you want and the sellers, merchants, and retailers offer you the product. Additionally, we offer a social media-esque platform to help you curate your perfect shopping list; allowing you to organize what you’re looking for in aesthetically pleasing categories and giving your posts more visibility. 

## Pain Point 
Just as users spend countless hours scrolling through various social media platforms. Online shoppers also spend a copious  amount of time scrolling through listings only to come away with absolutely nothing. To fix that, customers create the product listings because they know exactly what they want best.
